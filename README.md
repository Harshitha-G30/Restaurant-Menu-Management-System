# Restaurant-Menu-Management-System
The Restaurant Menu Management System is an essential component for efficient and organized operation 
in the food service industry. One crucial aspect of this system is the management of the menu items, their 
details, and their relationships. 
A Singly Linked List is a data structure in which each element, known as a node, contains data and a reference 
(link) to the next node in the sequence. It is particularly useful when the order of elements is important, 
making it suitable for applications like managing the sequence of menu items in a restaurant. 
Usage Of Linked List: 
1. Node Structure: The linked list is implemented using a node structure, where each node represents a detail 
of food. Each node contains data fields, such as the name of the food price of food, and a pointer to the next 
node in the list. 
2. Adding food items: New food items are added to the menu by creating a new node for food items and 
linking it to the existing list. This allows for the efficient insertion of food at the beginning or any position 
in the particular division (starter, main dish, beverages). 
3. Displaying food items: Traversal through the linked list allows for the display of the menu card with 
separate divisions of starters, main dishes, and beverages. Each node's information, such as the food name 
and price, can be printed or processed as needed. 
4. Dynamic Size: The linked list provides a dynamic-size food menu. Food items list can be added or 
removed without the need for pre-allocating a fixed-size array. 
5. Efficient Memory Management: Linked lists enable efficient memory management since nodes can be 
dynamically allocated and deallocated. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the menu size can 
change dynamically. 
The singly linked list data structure enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the digital menu card display 
project. It enables seamless management of the menu, making it easy to add, remove, and display food item 
names with prices in an organized manner.
